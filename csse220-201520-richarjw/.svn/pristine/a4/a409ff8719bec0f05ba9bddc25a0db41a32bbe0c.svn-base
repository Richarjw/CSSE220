/**
 * Creates some sample spacehsips.
 * 
 * If you code correctly, your bars should match the ones given on the exam
 * 
 * For stage one, you'll have to delete some example code.
 * 
 * When you are ready to move to stage 1 & 2 & 3, you'll need to uncomment some lines
 * 
 * YOU SHOULD NOT NEED TO MODIFY THIS CLASS (much) in any signifigant way
 * You shouldn't need to change the way DrawingSpaceship is used to make it work.
 * You can add to paintComponent to add additional ships for your testing.
